# Stacks Wars Smart Contracts

Stacks Wars is a **gaming utility platform** built on the **Stacks blockchain**, integrating various gaming experiences such as **casino games, sports betting, casual games, and aviator games**, all powered by **STX** as the primary mode of payment.

This repository contains the **Clarity smart contracts** that power the **Stacks Wars** ecosystem, handling **game logic, betting, and reward distribution** on-chain.

## ðŸ“Œ Repository Overview

This repo includes:

-   **Game Contracts**: Smart contracts for different game types.
-   **Betting System**: Secure and transparent betting mechanisms.
-   **Token Integration**: STX-based transactions and rewards.
-   **Property-Based Testing**: Fuzz testing using Rendezvous to verify contract behavior.
-   **Governance Functions**: (Upcoming) Community-driven game voting & proposals.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

-   **[Clarinet](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet)**
-   **[Rendezvous](https://github.com/stacks-network/rendezvous)** (for fuzz testing)
-   Node.js (for running scripts if needed)

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/iflames1/stacks-wars-contract/
cd contracts
```

### Running Tests

To run standard tests:

```sh
bun install
bun test
```

### Running Fuzz Tests with Rendezvous

For property-based testing with Rendezvous:

```sh
# Run property tests for a specific contract with signature dialer
rv . <contract-name> test --dial=./dialer.cjs

# Run invariant tests for a specific contract with signature dialer
rv . <contract-name> invariant --dial=./dialer.cjs

# Examples:
rv . factory test --dial=./dialer.cjs
rv . sponsored-pool test --dial=./dialer.cjs
rv . sponsored-ft-pool test --dial=./dialer.cjs

# Run with increased number of test runs
rv . factory test --dial=./dialer.cjs --runs=100
```

The dialer provides automatic signature generation for authenticated functions like `leave` and `claim-reward`.
